Part Designators (replace # with numerical)
JP#	Jumper Pads, for solder jumpers
Q#	Transistors
R#	Resistor
C#	Capacitor
L#	Inductor
IC#	Integrated Circuit
LED#	LED
X#	Connector

Device Naming
X-EU_YYYY

X denotes component type (R for resistor, C for capacitor,LED for LEDs)
YYYY denotes component size (0402, 0805, 1206, etc)

Examples: R-EU_0402, C-EU_0805, LED_0603


Package Naming
Use XYYYY for SMD such as capacitors and resistors
Example: C0402, R0805

Description should include any special requirements for the component

Part numbers would be useful, but not required
